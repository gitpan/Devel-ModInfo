Revision history for Perl module Devel::ModInfo

2.04 2014-04-24 NEILB
    - Realised there will probably be a lot of -I's going on in smokers,
      so adding those directories to the .PL scripts...

2.03 2014-04-22 NEILB
    - Still lots of fails, try using $^X in the #! path...

2.02 2014-04-22 NEILB
    - The .PL scripts were all setting the #! path to Config{startperl},
      which I think was causing a lot of failures due to Parse::RecDescent
      not being found.

2.01 2014-04-21 NEILB
    - Needed to install a new version of Pod::Checker to find the pod error
      that MetaCPAN was griping about :-(

2.00 2014-04-21 NEILB
    - Had to bump the version number because some of the sub-modules
      previously had a version number 1.3
    - Added MyModule to no_index -- it's an example in ex/
